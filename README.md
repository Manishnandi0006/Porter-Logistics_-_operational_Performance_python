#  Porter Logistics Data Analysis Project  

##  Overview  
This project analyzes a **real-world logistics dataset** from Porter to extract actionable business insights 
It combines **Data cleaning and preprocessing**,**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**,**Outlier handling**, and **feature engineering** techniques to understand order behavior, optimize delivery operations, and improve business performance.  

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of **197,528 records** and multiple features related to **orders, delivery partners, market IDs, revenue, and order protocols**.  
Each record represents an order placed through Porter’s logistics platform, including both categorical and numerical attributes.  

### Key feature groups:  
- **Order Information:** order size, volume, protocol type, market ID  
- **Delivery Details:** delivery time, order date & time  
- **Revenue Metrics:** revenue per order and total value  
- **Store Details:** primary category, item count, and order pattern  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Perform **comprehensive data analysis** to uncover operational and business insights.  
2. Identify **factors influencing delivery time, order volume, and revenue**.  
3. Derive **data-driven business recommendations** for logistics optimization.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
After performing detailed EDA, several important findings emerged:  

- 📅 **Order volume and revenue (₹90+ lakh)** are highest during **weekends**.  
- 🏪 **Top 10 store categories** account for **55% of total orders**.  
- 🔢 **Order Protocols 1, 3, and 5** handle **~75% of all orders** and revenue.  
- 📦 **~95% of orders** have an order size of **10 or less**.  
- 🕒 Most orders are placed between **12 PM – 4 PM**.  
- 📉 The **3rd week of each month** sees lower order volume than others.  
- ⚡ **Protocol 7** has the **fastest average delivery time**, while **Protocol 6** is the slowest.

## 🧠 Business Recommendations  
 
**Resource Planning:** 
- Increase on-shift partner count during weekends and 12 PM–4 PM to meet peak demand 
without compromising delivery speed.
- Run promotional campaigns during the 3rd week of the month to balance demand cycles.

**Category Strategy:** 
- Strengthen relationships with Top 10 high-volume categories, introduce loyalty or bundle 
- offers to retain this core segment. 

**Protocol Optimization:** 
- Analyze operational processes behind Protocol 7’s fast deliveries and standardize them across other protocols. 
- Investigate delays in Protocol 6 and redesign workflows or partner routing logic.

**Market Expansion:** 
- Benchmark performance of Markets 2, 4, and 1, replicate their strategies in lower-performing markets.
